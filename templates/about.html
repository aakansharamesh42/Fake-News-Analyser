  <p style="margin-top: -230px; margin-left:320px;margin-right:320px;">
    Unlike the earlier times, when newspapers dominated the market. People nowadays use mobile phones to read the news over the internet. There are different social media sites and news websites that publish news on the world wide web. The question arises about the authenticity of different news articles, especially on social networking sites where there is no check on fake news. Instead of actions being taken on fake news they are further boosted and even go viral on most social networking sites. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that on Twitter, fake news travels 6 times faster than real news and also receives 100 times more engagement. Believing in rumors and misinformation has dire consequences for the lives of people. Organized crimes and lynchings are also on the rise due to the lack of credible and real information sources. The need of today’s times is to stop the rumors, especially in developing countries like India, and focus on the correct, authenticated news articles. The main objective is to detect fake news, which is a classic text classification problem and can be solved using machine learning and text processing techniques. A model needs to be built that can differentiate between “Real” news and “Fake” news and also differentiate between “Clickbait” and “Non-clickbait” news. The proposed system helps to find the authenticity of the news.
